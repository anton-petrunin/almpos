\begin{thm}\label{thm:DDK}
Let $F$ be a finite simply connected CW complex and 
$Aut_0(F)$ be the identity component  of the 
space of all homotopy equivalences $F\to F$. Then $Aut_0(F)$ is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with a 
finite number of cells in each dimension.
\end{thm}

Let $\star=\id_F$ be the base point of $\Aut_0(F)$.

Furthermore, we consider $\mathbb{S}^1$ as the unit circle in the complex plane, so  that $z\mapsto z^n$ defines a map $\mathbb{S}^1\to \mathbb{S}^1$ of degree $n$.

\begin{cor}\label{cor:DDK}

Given a finite simply connected CW complex $F$, there is a natural number $n=n(F)$ such that the following  holds.

Assume that 
$\{\kappa_z\colon F\to F: z\in \mathbb{S}^1\}$ is a one parameter family of homotopy equivalences with $\kappa_1=\id_F$
such that for some $N\in\mathbb{N}$ the family $\kappa^N_z=\kappa_{z^N}$ is homotopic to the constant family $\mathrm{id}_F$. 
Then $\kappa^n_z$ is homotopic to the constant family $\mathrm{id}_F$.

\end{cor}

\begin{proof}[Proof.]
We can view $\kappa$ as a loop in $\Aut_0(F)$ based at $\star$.
Since $\Aut_0(F)$ is an $H$-space, its fundamental group  
$\pi_1(E_0(F))$ is abelian. 

By Theorem~\ref{thm:DDK}, $\pi_1(\Aut_0(F))$ is finitely generated,
therefore $\Tor[\pi_1(\Aut_0(F))]$ is finite.
Hence the corollary follows.
\end{proof}

We denote by $\DD$ the closed unit disc in the complex plane.

\begin{techlem}\label{techlem}
Let $F$ be a compact simply connected manifold and
$h\colon \DD\z\times F\z\to F$ be  a
$\DD$-family of homotopy equivalences $F\to F$ such that $h(u,*)=\mathrm{id}_F$ for any
$u\in\partial \DD$. 
Consider the map $\beta_x\colon \DD\to F$ defined by $\beta_x\colon u\mapsto h(u,x)$ for a fixed point $x\in F$. 
Then $[\beta_x]\in \mathrm{Tor}(\pi_2F)$ and is independent of $x$.

Moreover, given a map $f\colon \DD\to F$ let $f_h\co \DD\to F$ be given by $f_h(u)=h(u,f(u))$.
Note that  $f_h|_{\partial \DD}=f|_{\partial \DD}$. In particular, we can view $[f_h]-[f]$ as an element of $\pi_2F$.

Then 
$[f_h]-[f]=[\beta_x]\in \mathrm{Tor}(\pi_2F)$. 
\end{techlem}

\begin{proof}[Proof.] Assume the contrary. 

The map $h$ induces a map $\mathbb{S}^2\times F\to F$ which with a  slight abuse of notation we'll still denote by $h$. 
Consider the induced map on cohomology
\[H^{*+2}(F)\overset{h^*}{\longrightarrow} H^{*+2}(\mathbb{S}^2\times F)\to H^*(F)\otimes H^2(\mathbb{S}^2)\cong  H^*(F)\] where the second map is the projection coming from the K\"unneth isomorphism.
We'll denote the resulting map $H^{*+2}(F)\to H^*(F)$ by $D_h$. It's easy to see that it's an algebra derivation on $H^*(F)$. The same obviously holds true for $D_h^\QQ\colon H^{*+2}(F,\QQ)\to H^*(F,\QQ)$

%Then it the correspondent derivation 
%$$D_h\colon H^{k+2}(F)\to H^{k}(F)$$
 %has nontrivial element in the second cohomology; that is,
 We claim that  $D_h^\QQ$ vanishes on $H^2(F,\QQ)$. Suppose not and and that
  for some 
$\theta\in H^2(F,\QQ)$ we have $H^0(F,\QQ)\ni D_h^\QQ\theta\not=0$. 
Note that \[D_h^\QQ\theta^k=k{\cdot} \theta^{k-1}{\cdot} D_h^\QQ\theta.\] 




Therefore 
\[[\theta^{k-1}]\ne0
\quad
\Longrightarrow
\quad[\theta^{k}]\ne0.\]
Thus,  $[\theta^{k}]\not=0$ for any positive integer $k$.
In particular, $F$ has infinite dimension, a contradiction. 
Thus, $D^\QQ_h|_{H^2(F,\QQ)}\equiv 0$. Hence, $D_h|_{H^2(F)}\equiv 0$ and therefore $h^*=pr_2^*$ on $H^2(F)$ where $pr_2\colon \mathbb{S}^2\times F\to F$ is the second coordinate projection. 
This  easily implies the statement of the Lemma.
\end{proof}
\begin{rmk}
Since $[\beta_x] \in \pi_2F$ is independent of the choice of $x$, we can drop the subindex $x$ and simply denote this element by $[\beta]$.
\end{rmk} 

\subsection{}

\begin{claim}
Let $\mathbb{S}^1\to E\to B$ be an oriented $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a compact manifold $B$.
Assume that the action of $\pi_1B$ 
on $\pi_2B$ is trivial. 
Then  the action of $\pi_1E$ on $\pi_2E$ is trivial.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}[Proof.] 
Let $\gamma\in \pi_1(E,p)$ and $\alpha\in \pi_2(E,p)$. 
Let us denote by $\bar\gamma\in \pi_1(B,\bar p)$ and 
$\bar\alpha\in \pi_2(B,\bar p)$ their projection to $B$.

By our assumptions, $\bar\alpha^{\bar\gamma}=\bar\alpha$, or equivalently, there is a  map
$h\colon \mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1\to B$ such that 
$$h(u,v)=\bar p,\quad
h(u,*)\sim\bar\gamma\quad\text{ and}\quad
h(*,v)\sim\bar\alpha.$$

The induced bundle $\mathbb{S}^1\to E'\to \mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is trivial. 
Therefore the $\alpha^\gamma=\alpha$ 
for any element in $\gamma\in \pi_1E'$.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
Let $F\xrightarrow{i} E\to B$ be a fiber bundle with 
simply connected fiber $F$ over a compact manifold $B$, 
which admits a trivialization over the $1$-skeleton of $B$. 
Assume $\pi_1B$ is almost nilpotent 
and the action of $\pi_1B$ on $\pi_2B$ is almost trivial. 
Then  the action of $\pi_1E$ on $\pi_2E$ is almost trivial.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}[Proof.] 
By taking the pullback of $F\to E\to B$ to a finite cover of $B$ we can assume that  the action of $\pi_1B$ on $\pi_2B$ is trivial and $\pi_1B$ is nilpotent.

Let $\gamma\in \pi_1(E,p)$ and $\alpha\in \pi_2(E,p)$. 
Let us denote by $\bar\gamma\in \pi_1(B,\bar p)$ and 
$\bar\alpha\z\in \pi_2(B,\bar p)$ their projections to $B$.

By assumptions, there is a map
$h\colon \mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1\to B$ such that 
$$h(u,v)=\bar p,\quad
h(u,*)\sim\bar\gamma\quad\text{ and}\quad
h(*,v)\sim\bar\alpha.$$
The induced bundle $F\to E'\to \mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1$ admits a 
trivialization over $u\times \mathbb{S}^1$.
Let $E''$ be the  induced bundle $F\to E''\to \mathbb{S}^2\times v\subset \mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1$.
The  monodromy map $f\colon E''\to E''$ around $\mathbb{S}^1$
induces the  identity map on the base $\mathbb{S}^2$ 
and due the bundle being trivial  over $u\times \mathbb{S}^1$,
it  can be chosen to be the identity on $F_v$.

Consider a map $m\colon \DD\to \mathbb{S}^2$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item  $m$ is injective in the interior of $\DD$, 
\item  $m(\partial \DD)=v$.
\end{enumerate}
Fix a trivialization 
$F\times \DD$ of the induced bundle. 
Let 
$m'\colon F\times \DD\to E''$ be the correspondent mapping. 
By construction $m'(*,x)$ is a homeomorphism  between $F\times x$ and the fiber $F_{m(x)}$.
Then the map $f\colon E''\to E''$ is completely described by the map 
$$f'\colon F\times \DD\to F\times \DD $$ 
uniquely determined  by the  identity
$m'\circ f'=f\circ m'$. 
Clearly $f'(*,x)=\mathrm{id}_{F\times x}$ 
for any $x\in\partial \DD$.

By the Technical Lemma, there is an element 
$[\beta]\in \mathrm{Tor}(\pi_2F)$ such that 
\[[i(\beta)]=\alpha^\gamma-\alpha.\]
Since the bundle is trivial over $\mathbb{S}^1$,
\[[i(n{\cdot} \beta)]=\alpha^{\gamma^n}-\alpha\] and therefore for $n(F)=|\mathrm{Tor}(\pi_2F)|$ we have 
$\alpha^{\gamma^{n(F)}}-\alpha=0$. 

Since $\pi_1B$ is nilpotent and finitely generated we have that the subgroup  \[\langle\gamma^{n(F)}|\gamma\in \pi_1B\rangle<\pi_1B\] 
has finite index.
\end{proof}



\subsection{}

\begin{defn}
A compact connected manifold $M$ is called \emph{reliable} if 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{reliable1} For any 
$\tau\in \mathrm{Tor}(\pi_1(M,p))$ and for any other element $\gamma\in \pi_1(M,p)$ there is a map of $h\colon \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1\to M$  such that 
$$h(u,v)= p,\quad
h(u,*)\sim\gamma\quad\text{ and}\quad
h(*,v)\sim\tau.$$
\item \label{reliable2} There is a finite cover $\iota\colon \tilde T^2\z\to \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$ and a map of solid torus $f\colon \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1\z\to M$ and an isomorphism $i\colon \tilde T^2\to \partial \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$ such that $f\circ i=h\circ\iota$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{defn}

Evidently, if $M$ is \emph{reliable} then  $\mathrm{Tor}(\pi_1M)\subset \mathrm{Z}(\pi_1M)$.

\begin{claim}
 Let $\mathbb{S}^1\to E\to B$ be an oriented $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle such that the base  $B$ is reliable and the action of $\pi_1B$ on $\pi_2B$ is almost trivial. 
Then $E$ is reliable.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
Let $\gamma\in \pi_1(E,p)$ and $\tau\in \mathrm{Tor}(\pi_1(E,p))$. 
Let us denote by $\bar\gamma\in \pi_1(B,\bar p)$ and 
$\bar\tau\in \pi_1(B,\bar p)$ their projections to $B$.

From the assumptions we have 
that there is a map 
$\bar h\colon \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1\to B$ such that 
$$\bar h(u,v)=\bar p,\quad
\bar h(u,*)\sim\bar\gamma\quad\text{ and}\quad
\bar h(*,v)\sim\bar\tau,$$
which satisfy the definition of a reliable manifold.

Note that since $B$ is reliable we have $[h]=0\in H_2(B,\mathbb{Q})$. Therefore the induced bundle $\mathbb{S}^1\to E'\to \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is trivial, in particular $E'=T^3$. This  implies that $\gamma$ and $\tau$ commute. Hence \eqref{reliable1} is satisfied and we only need to check \eqref{reliable2}.

Since the bundle  $\mathbb{S}^1\to E'\to \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is trivial there is a lifting $h\colon \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1\to E$ of the map $\bar h$ such that
$$ h(u,v)= p,\quad
 h(u,*)\sim\gamma\quad\text{ and}\quad
 h(*,v)\sim\tau,$$
Consider the covering map $h\circ\iota\colon \tilde T^2\to E$.

By the definition of a reliable manifold there is a covering $\iota\colon \tilde T^2\z\to \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$ and a map of solid torus $\bar f\colon \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1\z\to B$ and an isomorphism $i\colon \tilde T^2\to \partial \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$ such that $\bar f\circ i=\bar h\circ\iota$. The pullback bundle $\mathbb{S}^1\to \tilde E'\to \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is trivial. Let $s\co  \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1\to  \tilde E'$ be a section.

By above 
we have that $h\circ\iota$ is homotopic to a map
$h'\colon \tilde T^2\to E$ whose projection to $B$ is the central $\mathbb{S}^1$ of 
$\DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$. 
Therefore there are loops $\psi\subset B$ and $\phi$ in a fiber $\mathbb{S}^1$  such that $h\circ\iota$ is homotopic to a torus with meridians in $s(\psi)$ and $\phi$.

Suppose 
$[\psi]$ has finite order in $\pi_1B$. By changing the cover $\tilde T\to T$ we can assume that $[\psi]=0$  in $\pi_1B$.  Then we can homotopy $h'$ to a single $\mathbb{S}^1$-fiber, and this easily gives the needed map of  a solid torus.

%<<<<<<< HEAD
%Otherwise, we have $i(\phi)\in \mathrm{Tor}(\pi_1E)$ 
%therefore passing to a finite cover of $\tilde T^2$ 
%if necessary we get a map of
%disc $\DD\to E$ which contracts one of generators ($k{\cdot} \phi$) of $\tilde T^2$.
%=======
Now suppose that $[\psi]$ has infinite order in $\pi_1B$. 
Let $\tilde\tau$ be the homotopy class of a component in the preimage of $\tau$ under the covering $\tilde T\to T$. 
On the level of  the fundamental groups we have that $\tilde\tau=[\phi]^a{\cdot} [s(\psi)]^b$ for some integer $a,b$. Projecting to $B$ we get that $\bar\tau=[\psi]^b$. Since $\tau$ is by assumption torsion and $[\psi]$ is not this means that $b=0$. Thus $\tilde\tau=[\phi]^a$ and hence
$i(\phi)\in \mathrm{Tor}(\pi_1E)$. 
Therefore passing to a finite cover of $\tilde T^2$ 
if necessary we get a map of the 
disc $\DD\to E$ which contracts one of the generators ($k \phi$) of $\tilde T^2$.
The projection of this disc to $B$ gives an element $\alpha\in \pi_2B$ 
and since $\pi_1B$ acting on $\pi_2B$ almost trivially we get 
that passing to finite cover of $\tilde T^2$ again (along $\psi$) we have a map of $\bar g\colon \mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1\to B$ with
$$ 
 \bar g(u,*)\sim\psi^l\quad\text{ and}\quad
 \bar g(*,v)\sim\alpha.$$
We can lift this map to a map $g\colon \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1\to E$ in such a way that $g\circ i=h'\circ \iota$. 
Together with the homotopy above, the latter gives the needed map of 
$\DD\times \mathbb{S}^1\z\to E$.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim} 
There is a positive integer $n=n(F,\dim B)$ such that the following holds.

Assume $F\to E\to B$ 
is a fiber bundle such that
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item the fiber $F$ is simply connected;
\item the base $B$ is reliable;
\item the fundamental group of $B$ is nilpotent and is generated by $\le c(\dim B)$ elements;
\item the bundle admits a trivialization over the $1$-skeleton of $B$.
\end{enumerate}
Then there is an at most $n$-fold cover $\tilde E$ of the  total space $E$ which is reliable.
%There is an $n=n(F,\dim B)$ such that if $F\to E\to B$  is a fiber bundle with simply connected fiber $F$, reliable base $B$ with nilpotent fundamental group on at most $c(\dim B)$ generators, which admits a trivialization over the $1$-skeleton of $B$ then there is a cover $\tilde E$ of the  total space $E$  which is at most $n$-fold and reliable.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof} The proof is divided into two steps.

\noindent\textit{Step 1.} 
We will use the Corollary~\ref{cor:DDK} 
to construct 
an at most $n=n(F,\dim B)$-fold cover $\widetilde B\to B$ 
such that for any two elements $\bar\gamma\in \pi_1(\tilde B,\bar p)$ and $\bar\tau\in \Tor \pi_1(\tilde B,\bar p)$ there is a map 
$\bar h\colon \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1\to \tilde B$ such that 
$$\bar h(u,v)=\bar p,\quad
\bar h(u,*)\sim\bar\gamma\quad\text{ and}\quad
\bar h(*,v)\sim\bar\tau,$$
which satisfy the condition in the  definition of reliable manifold and such that the induced bundle $\bar h^*$ over $\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$ with  fiber $F$ is homotopically trivial.

Let $\gamma\in \pi_1(E,p)$ and $\tau\in \mathrm{Tor}(\pi_1(E,p))$. 
Let us denote by $\bar\gamma\in \pi_1(B,\bar p)$ and 
$\bar\tau\in \pi_1(B,\bar p)$ their projections to $B$.

From the assumptions we have 
that there is a map 
$\bar h\colon \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1\to B$ such that 
$$\bar h(u,v)=\bar p,\quad
\bar h(u,*)\sim\bar\gamma\quad\text{ and}\quad
\bar h(*,v)\sim\bar\tau,$$
which satisfy condition \eqref{reliable1} in the definition of a reliable manifold.

The  induced bundle $f^*$ over $\DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$ 
is trivial since the bundle over $\mathbb{S}^1$ is. 
Consider the  induced bundle $\bar h^*$ over $\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$. 
Pulling back by the finite cover $\iota\colon \tilde T^2\to \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$ the induced bundle 
$(\bar h \circ \iota)^*$ over $\tilde T^2$ becomes trivial, since it is also can be induced vial pull back by $i\colon \tilde T^2\to \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$ and the bundle over $ \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is trivial. 
The bundle over $\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$ admits a trivialization on 1-skeleton 
for the standard  product CW-structure. 
Therefore it can be induced from a bundle on $\mathbb{S}^2$ and a map of degree 1 
which sends the  1-skeleton of $\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$ to a single point of $\mathbb{S}^2$. 
Such a bundle over $\mathbb{S}^2$ can be described by its clutching map which is a one-parameter family of homeomorphisms 
$\kappa\colon \mathbb{S}^1\times F\to F$.

Note that the  homotopy type of $\kappa$ does not depend on the choice of a
trivialization over the 1-skeleton of $\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$.
Since the induced bundle over $\tilde T^2$ is trivial we have that 
if $ \iota\colon  \tilde T^2\to \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is an $N$-fold cover then 
$\kappa^N\colon \mathbb{S}^1\times F\to F$ is homotopic to the map $(z,x)\mapsto x$.
By Corollary \ref{cor:DDK},  $\kappa^{n(F)}$ 
is homotopic to the constant map $(z,x)\mapsto x$.

Since $\pi_1 B$ is nilpotent and generated by $\le c(\dim B)$ elements,
it follows that there is  an at most $n'=n'(F,\dim B)$-fold  cover $\widetilde B$ of $B$ such that for any two elements $\bar\gamma\in \pi_1(\tilde B,\bar p)$ and $\bar\tau\in \pi_1(\tilde B,\bar p)$ there is a map 
$\bar h\colon \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1\to B$ such that 
$$\bar h(u,v)=\bar p,\quad
\bar h(u,*)\sim\bar\gamma\quad\text{ and}\quad
\bar h(*,v)\sim\bar\tau,$$
and such that the induced bundle $\bar h^*$ over $\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$ and fiber $F$ is homotopy trivial.

\medskip

From now on we will assume that that $B=\tilde B$.
%Let us pass to this covering (that is, from now on $B$ denotes $\widetilde B$) and continue.

\medskip

\noindent\textit{Step 2.} 
Now, using Technical Lemma~\ref{techlem}, 
we will prove that a section over 
$\bar h\colon \mathbb{S}^1\z\times \mathbb{S}^1\to B$, after finite cover (which is in fact a cover of $\tilde T^2$) bounds a solid torus;
that is, $ E$ is reliable. 

Let us summarize what we have:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{triv1} The  induced bundle $f^*$ over $\DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is trivial since the bundle over $\mathbb{S}^1$ is. 
\item \label{triv2} There is yet another  trivialization over $\partial \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1=\widetilde T^2$ which is induced from a  trivialization on $T^2=\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$.
\end{enumerate}


We can assume  that the bundle over $\DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is smooth and that
 both of the above trivializations are smooth. 
Consider the vector field $\bar V=\frac {\partial }{\partial t}$ on $\DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$;
here $t$ is the $\mathbb{S}^1$-coordinate and we assume $\mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$.

Let $p\co E'\to \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$ be the pullback bundle over  $\DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$. 

Let $ V$ be the horizontal lift of $\bar V$ over $\tilde T^2$ with respect to  trivialization \eqref{triv2} above. 
Using partition of unity we can extend it to a vector field (which we'll still denote by $V$) on $E'$  which projects to $\bar V$. 
Let $\phi_t\co E'\to E'$ be the time $t$ integral flow of $V$. 
%??? $F$ was used both for the map and the fiber. changed the map to $\pih_1$.
Note that by construction 
\begin{equation}\label{monodr-bry}
\phi_1(q)=q \text{ for any } q \in p^{-1}(\partial \DD\times\mathbb{S}^1).
\end{equation}

Since $E'$ is a trivial bundle we can identify its total space with $\DD\times F\times \mathbb{S}^1$ via, say, trivialization~\eqref{triv1} above. 
Consider the map  $m\co \DD\times F\times \mathbb{R}\to E$ given by the formula 
\[(u,x,t)\mapsto \phi_t(u,x,[0]),\]
here $u\in \DD$, $x\in F$ and $[0]\in \mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$.

By \eqref{monodr-bry} it follows that  $m(u,x,n)=m(u,x,0)$ for any $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, $u\in \partial \DD$ and $x\in F$.

Note that there is a map $\hat h\co \DD\times F\to F$ 
for which the following identity holds
\[m(u,\hat{h}(u,x),0)= m(u,x,1).\] 
Moreover $\hat h(u,x)=x$ for any $u\in\partial \DD$ and $x\in F$.
This means that we can apply Technical Lemma (\ref{techlem}) to $\hat h$.

Consider a horizontal section of $E'$ over $\partial \DD\times \mathbb{S}^1$ with respect to ~\eqref{triv2}. 
Fix $w\in \mathbb{S}^1$. 
This gives a with respect to ~\eqref{triv2} horizontal section over $\partial \DD\times w$.
Since 
 $F$ is simply connected this section can be extended to a section over $\DD\times w$ which in trivialization~\eqref{triv1} has the form $u\mapsto (u, w, f(u))$ for some map $f\co \DD\to F$.
As in Technical Lemma (\ref{techlem}) set  $f_{\hat h}(u)= \hat h(u,f(u))$.

Then , by Technical Lemma (\ref{techlem})
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:in-Tor}
[f_{\hat h}]-[f]=[\beta]\in \mathrm{Tor}(\pi_2F)
\end{equation}


Consider the sequence of maps $f^n\colon \DD\to F$ defined recursively, $f^0=f$ and $f^{n+1}=f^n_{\hat h}$.
By (\ref{eq:in-Tor}),
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:in-Tor-n}
[f^n]-[f^0]=n{\cdot}[\beta]=0
\end{equation}
for some positive integer $n$.

Note that 
$m(u,f^0(u),n)=m(u,f^n(u),0)$.
In particular, by (\ref{eq:in-Tor-n}),
the two maps $\DD\to E$ given by $u\mapsto m(u,f(u),0)$ and $u\mapsto m(u,f(u),n)$ are homotopic rel. to $\partial \DD$;
denote by $s_t$, $t\in[0,1]$ the homotopy.
It follows that after $n$-fold cover of $\widetilde T^2$ it has a section which can be contracted by a solid torus;
the map of solid torus is a concatenation of $(u,t)\mapsto m(u,f(u),t)$ for $t\in[0,n]$ 
and $(u,t)\to s_t(u)$ for $t\in[0,1]$. 
\end{proof}
